# Simple LAMP server installing script

This is just a simple script to automate the installing of LAMP.
Pretty basic stuff nothing extraordinary. Make sure you have read every line of it.

** _I'M NOT RESPONSIBLE IF ANY HARMS IS DONE._ **

## How does the script work

**It needs sudo, be carefull.**

1. Install _Apache_
2. Install _MySQL_
3. Install _PHP_ and some common features such as:
	* php-all-dev
	* php-cgi
	* php-cli
	* php-common
	* php-curl
	* php-dev
	* php-gd

If you don't like any of these just edit the script.


## Hope this is usefull to someone. Enjoy.
